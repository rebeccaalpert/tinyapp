# TinyApp
TinyApp is a very, very basic to-do list app written with React Native. It was created for COMP 150-MOB: Mobile Development at Tufts University in September 2017.

Requirements:
* Must use at least one image (met)
* Must use at least two views (met?)
* Must use at least two widgets (met? double check)
* Must have at least one transition between screens (met!)
* Open source license

## Usage Instructions
This is super difficult:
* Click the "add" button to add a to-do
* Type in your to-do 

## Running Requirements
Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) is required to run this little guy.

## What I Learned
* Read the documentation. Then read the documentation again. Then, when things break, read the documentation again.
* React Native's documentation is great (except for states).
* React Native uses Javascript, but it's weird, and styles are similar to CSS but just different enough to trip you up on syntax.
* I'm out of practice with Javascript.
* It's hard to share data between components in React Native, which I only learned after I spent a ton of time working on this thing, which requires sharing data between components.
