# TinyApp
TinyApp is a very, very basic cat viewing app written with React Native. It was created for COMP 150-MOB: Mobile Development at Tufts University in September 2017.

Requirements:
* Must use at least one image (met)
* Must use at least two views (met)
* Must use at least two widgets (met)
* Must have at least one transition between screens (met)

## Usage Instructions
This is super difficult:
* Click the button
* Scroll through cat pictures

## Running Requirements
Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) is required to run this little guy.

## What I Learned
* Read the documentation. 
* React Native's documentation is great (except for states).
* React Native uses Javascript, but it's weird, and styles are similar to CSS but just different enough to trip you up on syntax.
* It's hard to share states between components in React Native, which is why I downsized from a to-do list app to a silly cat viewing app.
